import { Markdown } from "../../components/react/markdown.tsx"

Discord also supports code blocks as well.  You can make your own code blocks by wrapping your text in backticks (\`)

<Markdown client:load value={`\`In line code blocks are cool\``}/>

You can also use three backticks (\`\`\`) to create multiline code blocks, like this beautifully written haiku.

<Markdown client:load value={`\`\`\`
multi line comment
\`\`\``}/>
