import { Markdown } from "../../components/react/markdown.tsx"

You can manually tag spoilers by using the syntax `||` around your text or by typing `/spoiler` before your message. This is also negated by a code block.

<Markdown 
  client:load 
  discordCallback={{ slashCommand: "/info" }}
>
{"||this is hidden||"}
</Markdown>
